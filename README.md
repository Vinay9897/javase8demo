//Enums

--An enum is a non-primitive data type that contains a fixed set of constants.
--All the constants are static and final implicitly.
--All enums implicitly extend java.lang.Enum class.
Since enums are reference data types, like class or interface, and hence, --we can define constructors, methods, and variables in an enum.
